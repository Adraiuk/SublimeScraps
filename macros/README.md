Macros
------

Is there more than one of these here? If so I probably forgot to update this
README file; shame on me.

Anyway, this macro is referenced from one of the key bindings in the
**customizations** folder, and it meant to be bound to whatever key you
normally use to toggle a line comment.

In JetBrains tools, that command will advance the cursor down a line when you
invoke it (unless text is selected), and this mimics that behaviour. It's one
of the few things that I miss from using those tools.
