User Package Customizations
---------------------------

The files here are files that I keep in my `User` package that I use to
customize Sublime Text 3 to my whims and desires. There's nothing ground
breaking or earth shattering here.

However, since I use git to keep my `User` package backed up and synced across
all of my machines, and this repository started as a clone of that one, here
we are.

Note that I use Sublime Text over all three platforms and everything here will
work across all platforms. However, for the sake of brevity I included my
custom key bindings as a single file which has entirely the wrong name.

Should you actually be interested in the bindings themselves, I recommend
copying them to your own bindings file.
