Snippets
--------

One of the great features of Sublime Text, Snippets are super awesome for a lot
of reasons. You can use them to quickly enter vast swatches of text to make your
life easier, for one thing.

If you happen to have a terrible memory like I do, then you can use them for
other things, such as reminding you of the structure of things that you don't
normally use.

The snippets stored here fall into both categories. For test purposes I create a
lot of key bindings, so some of the bindings save time. Sometimes these bindings
need a `context`, and that's when I normally have to look at the default
bindings to remember how that usually goes.

***Boom***, snippets to the rescue.
